# Firebase Signup/Login Assessment

This is a React Single Page App to demonstrate the functionality of Signing up with email and password using Google Firebase.
A user can register and sign in. Upon signing in a user will reach a Welcome page prompting navigation to the Profile Page, where they can set a display name and update their password.

The Welcome page won't be reachable if a user is not authenticated.
If a user navigates to the sign in page while already being athenticated, they will be redirected to the welcome page.
